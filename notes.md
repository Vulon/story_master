# Plans

Redesign the map generation. 
Create a strict hierarchy, where the first level must be a 
large region. The region is divided into provinces.
Each province is divided into settlements and areas like forests, countryside. 
Settlements are divided into districts. Districts are divided into buildings.
Settlements should have special rules for generating buildings.
There must be a list of essential buildings that must be present in a settlement.
