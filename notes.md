# Memory
For character memory should implement solution from the paper:
"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"

Every character should have a list of memories. 
Need to implement retrieval module that will use timestamp, importance and relevance(based on embeddings) to retrieve memories. 
Once in a while should run the reflection process to create thoughts based on memories. 
Create plans
Decompose those plans. 

Implement the environment map. 
Every character can have a different environment map.

# Plan

1. Create pydantic classes for locations 
2. Create mechanism for storing objects in text files
3. Implement some locations
